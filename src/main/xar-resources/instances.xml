<!--
    This file lists external eXist-db servers to be monitored by the local instance.
    
    Each entry needs to provide three attributes:
    
    * name: a short name for the server used for display
    * url: the URL leading to the root context of eXist
    * token: the unique authentication token of the jmx servlet running on the instance.
    Since eXist 2.2, the token can be found in a file jmxservlet.token which is automatically
    generated in the server's data directory. Older versions of eXist do not require an
    authentication token, so just leave the attribute empty.
